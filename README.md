## Detail
#### This robot's body and legs are made of MDF, and motor boxes are made by 3D printer. Each leg has 3 servo mortors (the total is 12), and two infrared sensor are attached to the front.
#### This program is for walking and PK. This robot can detect the object(soccer ball) in a range of 80 cm. If it is rolling in a range of the threshold, the robot defends the goal by putting its arms down.
### Software
#### Controll : Arduino Uno
#### Sensor : GP2Y0A21YK
#### Motor : Servo - Generic Metal Gear
